## 📦 Release date and how it will be incorporated.
> Due to a lack of funding, we may reach a limit of users. If you would [consider donating](https://paypal.me/a1dos?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US) to help fund this project, it would be very much apreciated!

Although I am still developing some features, this backend is now working and live!

Create an account here: https://a1dos-creations.com/account/auth

Users will be able to link their Google account to their A1 account, allowing their Google Classroom tasks to sync to their tasks on STL. Tasks created on STL will also be added to the user's Google Calendar. These features are optional and will be able to be turned off at any time.
